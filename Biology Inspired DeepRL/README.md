## Biology inspired reinforcement learning

The following must be specified upon initalization:
- DNA string length: number of bits in DNA string (throught to be proportional to initial complexity of models). Minimum is 100.
- Mutation risk: default is 1e-3

This is a project under development.

It currently creates the neural network and can mutate, but is does not train on anything and has no capability to improve through generations.
