Throught it would be nice to visualize some pathfinding algorithms and study how they work, so I made this.

To run the simulation run:
```
python3 simulation.py
```

This will run both baseline solvers, first the random, then the circular one. You need to close the app to move on the next.

## Current solvers:
- BaselineSolvers: Both a random and a circular solver. CircleBaselineSolver is basically the theory behind [Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm](https://www.graphable.ai/blog/pathfinding-algorithms/), but since there is no difference in the length between nodes, this becomes a simple circular solver
- [A*](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-search-algorithm/): Dependent on knowing the end point to work. Large improvement over BaselineSolvers

Random Solver: | Circular Solver | A* Solver: 
:-------------:|:---------------:|:----------:
Finished in 397 moves | Finished in 313 moves | Finished in 199 moves

## Notes for the future
- Maybe train some deep RL on this?
- Could be fun to add fog to the agent and visualize with fog?
- Maybe make some red stations, which are the only places the AI can choose to go, although the aim should still be to travel the least amount of tiles overall.
- Maybe make some forests, lakes that takes longer to get through?
