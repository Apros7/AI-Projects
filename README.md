# AI-Projects
This folder currently includes 4 projects:
- Detect Handwritten Numbers: A tensorflow keras model trained on the MNIST dataset. Got it to an accuracy of 96%
- Twitter Sentiment Analysis: A fine-tuned BERT model, tf-idf vectorizer used to determine sentiment on tweets. Top accuracy is 86%
- Impersonator: Different AI-models to impersonate some text. So far this includes bigram, single layer NN, multi layer NN and RNN. The example is creating new names.
- MNIST synthetic data generation (label to picture): Currently has three models: A basic probability model, a simple NN and a more complex GAN. GAN showed great images after only 50 epochs (around 10 minutes of training time on Macbook M1).
