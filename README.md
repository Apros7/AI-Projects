- Twitter Sentiment Analysis: A fine-tuned BERT model, tf-idf vectorizer used to determine sentiment on tweets. Top accuracy is 86%
- Impersonator: Different AI-models to impersonate some text. So far this includes bigram, single layer NN, multi layer NN and RNN. The example is names.
- MNIST synthetic data generation (label to picture): Currently has three models: A basic probability model, a simple NN and a more complex GAN.
