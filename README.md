# AI-Projects
This folder currently includes 6 main projects:
- Biology Inspired Deep Reinforcement learning: Using techniques of virus to shape and optimize neural networks. 
- Connect4Reinforcement: Connect 4 Introduction to Reinforcement Learning on Kaggle.
- Detect Handwritten Numbers: A tensorflow keras and pytorch model trained on the MNIST dataset. Got it to an accuracy of 98.6%
- Twitter Sentiment Analysis: A fine-tuned BERT model and trained tf-idf vectorizer used to determine sentiment on tweets. Top accuracy is 86%
- Impersonator: Different AI-models to impersonate some text. So far this includes bigram, single layer NN, multi layer NN and RNN. The example is creating new names.
- MNIST synthetic data generation (label to picture): Currently has three models: A basic probability model, a simple NN and a more complex GAN. GAN showed great images after only 50 epochs (around 10 minutes of training time on Macbook M1).
- Pathfinding Algorithms: from scratch using pygame to simulate and python to test various algorithms.
- Autograd: Autograd engine that can fit NN to MNIST from scratch only using NumPy
