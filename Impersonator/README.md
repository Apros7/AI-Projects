## Impersonator
Impersonator is a series of machine-learning algorithms to continue on a list of strings and impersonate the same style.
This is based on Andrej Karpathy's make more.

It currently includes the following models:
- Bigram


#### Bigram

The first 10 names from the Bigram is:

```
mor
axx
minaymoryles
kondlaisah
anchshizarie
odaren
iaddash
h
jhinatien
egushl
```

Hopefully other models perform better :/!
