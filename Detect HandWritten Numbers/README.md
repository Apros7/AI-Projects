### Neural Network on MNIST dataset
**Tensorflow**: The only code I have written is the model. Everything else is from this [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/tensorflow-without-a-phd/blob/master/tensorflow-mnist-tutorial/keras_01_mnist.ipynb#scrollTo=56y8UNFQIVwj)

**Pytorch**: Everything by me. Also used Cleanlab to clean the dataset before training and testing.

I achieved an accuracy of 98.612 %
